cute application for building logic schemes based on linear boolean functions  

choose components on the left side by double click and place them on canvas  
move selected component with `WASD`  
slow or speed up components with cyclical pressing `Shift`  
activate cursor mode with `C`   
it is default after opening app  
activate wire mode with `X`   
theese wires are started on components' out entries  
and are ended on components' in entries  
press `Alt` to end the wire
press `Z` to have branch wire mode  
now u can start wires on other wires  
moving components with connected wires is not recommended  
inclined lines are appeared  
it will be better to save the scheme topology  
delete selected object with `Del`  
activate model mode with `V`  
the scheme will come to life
